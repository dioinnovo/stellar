## SECTION 1: Policy Intelligence (3 minutes)

### 1.1 Policy Upload Demo (45 seconds)
**Screen:** Click the attachment button (+)

**Say:**
> "Let's say you just received a new claim with a 200-page homeowner's policy. Watch how quickly Stella analyzes it."

**Actions:**
1. Click attachment button
2. Select "Upload Policy"
3. Drag and drop sample policy PDF
4. Show upload confirmation

**Show Message:**
```
You: "I've uploaded my client's homeowner's policy.
Can you analyze it for water damage coverage?"
```

### 1.2 Instant Analysis (1 minute)
**Screen:** Show Stella's response appearing

**Stella's Response:**
```
I've analyzed the uploaded policy (State Farm HO-3,
Policy #24-BE-9847651-3). Here's your water damage
coverage analysis:

COVERED PERILS:
✓ Sudden and accidental water discharge (Page 18)
✓ Water damage from plumbing systems (Page 19)
✓ Overflow from appliances (Page 19)
✓ Ice dam damage (Page 23)

EXCLUSIONS WITH EXCEPTIONS:
⚠️ Gradual seepage excluded EXCEPT if hidden (Page 45)
⚠️ Mold excluded EXCEPT resulting from covered loss (Page 47)
⚠️ Foundation damage excluded EXCEPT from burst pipes (Page 51)

ADDITIONAL COVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES:
💰 Code Upgrade Coverage: $25,000 limit (Page 67)
💰 Additional Living Expenses: $40,000 limit (Page 71)
💰 Emergency Repairs: $5,000 immediate (Page 29)

Would you like me to explain any specific provision?
```

**Emphasize:**
> "In 15 seconds, Stella found coverage opportunities that would take hours to discover manually. Notice the page references—you can verify everything."

### 1.3 Deep Dive Questions (1 minute 15 seconds)
**Screen:** Continue conversation

**Your Question:**
```
"The insurer says mold damage isn't covered.
How can I counter this?"
```

**Stella's Response:**
```
Based on the policy language on Page 47, Section 3.B.2:

STRONG COUNTER-ARGUMENT:
The mold exclusion explicitly states: "We do not cover
mold, fungus or wet rot. However, we do cover mold,
fungus or wet rot that is hidden within the walls or
ceilings or beneath the floors IF such loss results
from the accidental discharge of water."

KEY POINTS FOR YOUR ARGUMENT:
1. The water damage (covered peril) occurred first
2. Mold is a direct result of the covered water damage
3. Policy explicitly provides exception for this scenario
4. Case law: Johnson v. State Farm (2019) - similar
   situation ruled in favor of policyholder

SUGGESTED RESPONSE TO INSURER:
"Per Section 3.B.2 of the policy, mold resulting from
covered water damage is explicitly included. The water
discharge on [date] was a covered peril, making
subsequent mold damage covered as well."

Success Rate: 89% based on 34 similar disputes
```

**Key Point:**
> "Stella doesn't just read the policy—she understands it, knows the exceptions, and even provides case law and success rates from your historical data."

## SECTION 2: Real-Time Consultation (3 minutes)

### 2.1 Complex Coverage Questions (1 minute)
**Screen:** New question in chat

**Your Question:**
```
"My client's kitchen has water damage. The cabinets
are partially damaged. What coverage applies beyond
just replacing the damaged cabinets?"
```

**Stella's Response:**
```
Excellent question! For kitchen water damage, you have
multiple coverage angles:

1. MATCHING COVERAGE (Line of Sight Rule):
   - Policy Page 54: "When a loss causes damage to an
     item that is part of a set, we will pay to repair
     or replace the entire set"
   - Kitchen cabinets qualify as a "set"
   - Estimated additional value: $18,000

2. CODE UPGRADE COVERAGE:
   - Policy Page 67: Ordinance or Law coverage
   - Kitchen must meet 2024 building codes
   - New GFCI outlets required near water sources
   - Estimated additional: $8,500

3. ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES (ALE):
   - Kitchen unusable = home uninhabitable
   - Policy Page 71: $200/day limit
   - Typical kitchen restoration: 45 days
   - Potential ALE claim: $9,000

4. PERSONAL PROPERTY IN KITCHEN:
   - Small appliances, dishes, food
   - Policy Page 33: Replacement cost coverage
   - Don't forget refrigerator/freezer contents
   - Estimated additional: $3,500

TOTAL ADDITIONAL COVERAGE: $39,000
(Beyond direct cabinet damage)
```

**Emphasize:**
> "That's $39,000 in legitimate coverage that many adjusters miss because they don't have time to read every provision and connect the dots."

### 2.2 Damage Documentation Support (1 minute)
**Screen:** Upload photos through chat

**Say:**
> "Stella can also analyze damage photos to strengthen your claim."

**Your Action:**
1. Click attachment button
2. Select "Upload Photos"
3. Upload 3-4 damage photos

**Your Question:**
```
"I've uploaded photos from today's inspection.
What should I document further?"
```

**Stella's Response:**
```
Analyzing uploaded photos... I can see water damage
in the kitchen area. Based on the damage patterns:

CRITICAL ITEMS TO DOCUMENT:
1. ⚠️ URGENT: Moisture readings behind upper cabinets
   - Visible staining suggests water traveled upward
   - Check inside wall cavity for hidden damage

2. 📸 MISSING DOCUMENTATION:
   - Close-up of flooring transitions to adjacent rooms
   - Underneath sink plumbing connections
   - Ceiling directly above damage (check floor above)
   - Electrical outlets near water damage

3. 🔍 EVIDENCE OF ADDITIONAL DAMAGE:
   - Photo #2 shows possible mold beginning (dark spots)
   - Photo #3 indicates subflooring damage (warping)
   - Baseboard separation suggests prolonged exposure

4. 💡 STRATEGIC PHOTOS NEEDED:
   - Wide shot showing "line of sight" for matching claim
   - Model/serial numbers of damaged appliances
   - Any visible code violations (support upgrade claim)

PRO TIP: The water stain pattern suggests damage
occurred over 72+ hours. This strengthens your ALE
claim for extended displacement.
```

**Key Point:**
> "Stella isn't just a policy reader—she's like having a senior adjuster looking over your shoulder, guiding you to build the strongest possible case."

### 2.3 Negotiation Preparation (1 minute)
**Screen:** Continue conversation

**Your Question:**
```
"The insurer offered $45,000 total. How do I counter?"
```

**Stella's Response:**
```
Their offer of $45,000 is significantly below justified
damages. Here's your counter-strategy:

CURRENT OFFER ANALYSIS:
Insurer's Offer: $45,000
Justified Claim: $127,000 (based on my analysis)
Gap: $82,000 (65% underpayment)

COUNTER-OFFER STRATEGY:

Opening Position: $145,000
- Include all discovered coverage
- Add 15% negotiation buffer
- Cite comparable settlements

Supporting Evidence Package:
1. Kitchen cabinet set: $28,000 (matching coverage)
2. Code upgrades: $8,500 (required by law)
3. Hidden damage: $15,000 (your photos show evidence)
4. Mold remediation: $12,000 (resulting from covered peril)
5. ALE for 45 days: $9,000
6. Contents/personal property: $3,500
7. Professional remediation: $35,000
8. Subfloor replacement: $16,000

NEGOTIATION SCRIPT:
"We've documented $127,000 in covered damages per the
policy terms. Your offer of $45,000 represents only 35%
of actual damages. See attached documentation with
specific policy provisions and photo evidence. We're
prepared to settle immediately at $115,000, saving
both parties time and potential appraisal costs."

Based on 156 similar negotiations:
- 73% settled within 15% of counter
- Average settlement: $108,000
- Typical negotiation duration: 12 days
```

**Emphasize:**
> "This isn't just a number—it's a complete strategy with evidence, scripts, and success probabilities based on real data."
