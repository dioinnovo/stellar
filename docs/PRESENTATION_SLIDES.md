# SLIDE 2: The Opening Story
### From $105,000 to $310,000
#### One Adjuster. One Claim. One Platform.

**Visual Elements:**
- Photo of water-damaged Miami home
- Animated counter showing settlement increase
- Timeline: 6 weeks from start to maximized settlement

**Speaker Note (30 seconds):**
"Let me start with Sarah Thompson's story. Miami public adjuster, 15 years experience. Water damage claim. Insurance offered $105,000. Using Stellar, she discovered overlooked coverage and hidden damages, settling for $310,000. This isn't an anomaly—it's what happens when expertise meets intelligence."

---

# SLIDE 3: The Industry Reality
### Public Adjusters: The Unsung Heroes

**Visual Elements (4 animated stats appearing sequentially):**
1. **574% Higher Settlements** (icon: upward arrow with dollar signs)
2. **89% Call It a "Second Full-Time Job"** (icon: clock showing overtime)
3. **60+ Hour Weeks During CAT Season** (icon: hurricane symbol)
4. **$50K+ Overlooked Coverage Per Claim** (icon: magnifying glass over policy)

**Speaker Note (45 seconds):**
"You achieve remarkable results for your clients—574% higher settlements on average. But at what personal cost? 89% of you describe this as essentially working two full-time jobs. The question isn't whether you're effective—it's whether you're operating at maximum efficiency."

---

# SLIDE 4: The Four Battlefronts
### Every Day, You Fight on Multiple Fronts

**Visual Elements (4 quadrants with icons):**
1. **Documentation Marathon** (icon: camera + stacks of paper)
2. **Policy Maze** (icon: complex maze pattern)
3. **Time Thief** (icon: hourglass running out)
4. **Knowledge Silo** (icon: disconnected puzzle pieces)

**Speaker Note (60 seconds):**
"You're fighting four battles simultaneously. The documentation marathon—photographing, cataloging, organizing hundreds of items. The policy maze—200+ pages hiding crucial coverage. Time as your enemy—managing 20 claims while each demands full attention. And knowledge silos—your hard-won experience isn't systematized. What if you could win all four battles at once?"

---

# SLIDE 5: The Hidden Costs
### What's Really at Stake

**Visual Elements (animated revelation of costs):**
- **Per Claim**: $50,000 in missed coverage
- **Per Month**: 120 hours of administrative work
- **Per Year**: 15-20 claims declined due to capacity
- **Career Impact**: Burnout, errors, client dissatisfaction

**Speaker Note (45 seconds):**
"Let's quantify the real impact. Every claim risks $50,000 in overlooked coverage. You spend 120 hours monthly on paperwork instead of advocacy. You're turning away 15-20 claims yearly due to capacity. This isn't sustainable, and your clients deserve better."
