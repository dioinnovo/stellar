## OPENING: THE DAVID VS GOLIATH STORY (3 minutes)

### The Hook
> "Picture this: Sarah Thompson, a Miami public adjuster, receives a water damage claim. The insurance company's initial offer: $105,000. Six weeks later, after using Stellar, she settles for $310,000. This isn't luck—it's intelligence amplified by technology."

### The Industry Reality
- **574% Higher Settlements**: Public adjusters achieve dramatically higher payouts
- **The Hidden Cost**: 89% describe claims processing as a "full-time job within a job"
- **The Time Crisis**: Average claim takes 18-60 days to settle
- **The Documentation Burden**: 200+ page policies, hundreds of items to document

### The Promise
"Today, we'll show you how Stellar transforms your expertise into systematic success—ensuring no coverage is overlooked, no damage undocumented, and no settlement left unmaximized."

## ACT 1: ACKNOWLEDGING THE HIDDEN BATTLES (5 minutes)

### The Four Frontlines Every Public Adjuster Faces

#### 1. The Documentation Marathon
- **Current Reality**:
  - Photographing and cataloging hundreds of items
  - Hand-written notes transcribed multiple times
  - Hours organizing evidence for a single claim
- **The Cost**: 40% of billable time spent on administrative tasks

#### 2. The Policy Maze
- **Current Reality**:
  - 200+ pages of complex insurance language
  - Hidden endorsements and sub-limits
  - Exclusions with exceptions buried in footnotes
- **The Cost**: $50,000+ in overlooked coverage per claim

#### 3. The Time Thief
- **Current Reality**:
  - Managing 15-20 active claims simultaneously
  - 18+ days average negotiation timeline
  - 60+ hour weeks during catastrophe season
- **The Cost**: Burnout, errors, and missed opportunities

#### 4. The Knowledge Gap
- **Current Reality**:
  - Each adjuster's experience siloed
  - No systematic way to leverage past wins
  - Technology advancing while processes remain manual
- **The Cost**: Inconsistent outcomes, repeated mistakes

### The Transformation Question
> "What if every inspection you've ever done, every successful negotiation, every discovered coverage became part of your active intelligence? What if technology could ensure you never miss what you've found before?"
