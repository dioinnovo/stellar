## TOP 10 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### 1. "How long does implementation take?"
**Short Answer:**
> "You'll be processing your first claim within 5 days."

**Detailed Answer:**
> "Implementation is remarkably fast. Day 1-2 is platform setup and data migration. Day 3-4 is custom training on your specific policy types. Day 5 you're processing your first live claim. Within two weeks, your entire team is fully operational. We've refined this process with over 50 firms."

**Proof Point:** Show implementation timeline slide

### 4. "What's the real ROI?"
**Short Answer:**
> "Average 12x return in year one. One properly maximized claim pays for the annual cost."

**Detailed Answer:**
> "Let's use real numbers. Average settlement increase: 34%. On just 10 claims averaging $150,000, that's $510,000 in additional recovery. Your 10% contingency fee equals $51,000 in additional revenue. Annual Stellar investment: $75,000. But you're also handling 40% more claims with the same team. The math is undeniable."

**ROI Breakdown:**
- Settlement increases: $51,000
- Additional capacity revenue: $84,000

**Detailed Answer:**
> "Stella's recommendations have a 94% success rate when implemented. But here's the key—she never makes decisions for you.

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### OBJECTION: "It's too expensive"
**Response:**
> "I understand cost is always a concern. Let me ask you this: How much money did you leave on the table last year from overlooked coverage? One missed code upgrade provision costs your client $25,000. Stellar finds these automatically. The system pays for itself with just one properly maximized claim. Can you afford NOT to have this capability?"

**Follow-up:**
> "We also offer flexible payment plans and a money-back guarantee if you don't see ROI within 90 days."

---

### OBJECTION: "We don't have time to learn new software"
**Response:**
> "That's exactly why we designed Stellar to be intuitive. Most adjusters are productive within hours, not days. But here's the real question: You don't have time to learn software that saves you 20 hours per week? The time you invest in learning Stellar—maybe 4 hours total—you'll recoup in your first week of use."

**Proof:**
> "Maria Garcia learned Stellar in one morning and found $180,000 in overlooked coverage that same afternoon."

---

### OBJECTION: "Our team won't adopt it"
**Response:**
> "Change resistance is natural. That's why we have a 95% adoption rate—because adjusters quickly see it makes their lives easier, not harder. Your senior adjusters will love having instant policy analysis. Your junior adjusters will love having senior-level guidance. Everyone loves going home on time."

**Success Story:**
> "Precision Public Adjusting had the same concern. Six months later, their adjusters said they'd quit if the firm stopped using Stellar. It becomes indispensable."

---

### OBJECTION: "We're too small for this"
**Response:**
> "Actually, smaller firms see the highest ROI because Stellar gives you the capabilities of a large firm. You can compete for bigger claims, handle more volume without hiring, and punch above your weight class. It's not about being too small—it's about being too small NOT to have this advantage."

---

### OBJECTION: "We're too large for this"
**Response:**
> "Large firms benefit from standardization and knowledge sharing across teams. Imagine every adjuster having access to your firm's collective intelligence. No more siloed expertise. No more inconsistent approaches. Stellar scales infinitely—our largest client has 200+ adjusters using it daily."

---

### OBJECTION: "AI will replace adjusters"
**Response:**
> "If AI was going to replace adjusters, insurance companies would have done it already. They haven't because claims require human judgment, empathy, and advocacy. Stellar doesn't replace adjusters—it makes them superhuman. You still make every decision; you just make them with perfect information."

---

### OBJECTION: "What if it makes mistakes?"
**Response:**
> "Stellar doesn't make final decisions—you do. Every recommendation includes source documentation you can verify. Think of it like GPS—it suggests the route, but you're still driving. And with 94% accuracy on recommendations, it's right far more often than manual research."

---

### OBJECTION: "We need to think about it"
**Response:**
> "Of course, this is an important decision. While you're thinking, your competitors might be implementing. Every day you delay is potentially $3,000 in missed additional recovery. What specific concerns can I address to help you make the right decision today? Also, our pilot program lets you try it risk-free with 5 claims."

---

### OBJECTION: "We want to wait and see"
**Response:**
> "I understand wanting to see results. That's why we publish monthly success metrics from current users—34% average settlement increase, 50% time savings. But while you wait, you're losing money on every claim. Our pilot program lets you see results with your own claims, risk-free. Why not start seeing instead of waiting?"

---

### OBJECTION: "Our process works fine"
**Response:**
> "I'm sure it does, and Stellar won't change what works. It enhances it. You're probably excellent at finding coverage and maximizing settlements. But are you finding EVERYTHING? Every time? Stellar ensures nothing gets missed. It's not about fixing what's broken—it's about making what works work even better."

## CLOSING OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "Send us information to review"
> "I'll send everything immediately. But information doesn't convey the power of seeing Stellar in action. Let's schedule a personalized demo with your actual claim types. How's Thursday at 2 PM?"

### "We need board approval"
> "Understood. What would the board need to see to approve this? I can prepare a customized ROI analysis and executive summary. Better yet, our pilot program shows results without long-term commitment. The board loves risk-free wins."

### "Call us next quarter"
> "I'll absolutely follow up. But consider this—if Stellar delivers just a conservative 20% settlement increase, waiting 3 months costs you approximately $150,000 in missed recovery. The pilot program can start showing results while you're making the formal decision. Why leave money on the table?"

### "We're not interested"
> "I appreciate your directness. May I ask—is it because you don't believe the ROI, or is there another concern? Most initial skeptics become our biggest advocates after seeing results. What would it take to earn 30 minutes to show you actual results from firms just like yours?"

---

## EMERGENCY RESPONSES

### If competitor is mentioned:
> "We respect all solutions in the market. What makes Stellar unique is our focus on public adjusters specifically, not insurance companies. Plus, our AI is trained on successful public adjuster strategies, not insurer tactics."

### If they had bad tech experience:
> "I understand that frustration. That's why we offer the pilot program—see real results before committing. And our 95% retention rate shows that once adjusters use Stellar, they never go back."

### If they're skeptical of AI:
> "Skepticism is healthy. That's why every AI recommendation includes verification sources. You're always in control. Think of AI as your brilliant intern who never sleeps—helpful but always supervised."

---

## ONE-LINER CLOSERS

- "Your competitors are already using AI. Will you join them or fall behind?"

## FINAL THOUGHT

Remember: You're not selling software. You're selling transformation. You're selling nights at home instead of the office. You're selling confidence in negotiations. You're selling the ability to help more clients without burning out. You're selling success.

Every objection is just a request for more information. Every question is an opportunity to demonstrate value. Every concern is a chance to show you understand their world.

You've got this. Stellar sells itself—you just need to show them what's possible.
